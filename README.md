# Unarmed 3rd Person Character for Unreal Engine

In this tutorial will you learn how to create a basic Unarmed 3rd Person Character equipped with Inputs and Animations. This tutorial will use the Unreal Engine Mannequins for the Mesh along with Animations from the Third Person Template & Lyra Project. Together these Animations will give us the ability to Move, Look, Crouch, and Jump. These will be the foundation for all the 3rd Person Character Tutorials moving forward to help keep everyone synced and on the same page.
